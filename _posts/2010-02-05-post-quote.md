I added the "process" into the below Deming quote. It seems just as appropriate.

> A bad system (process) will beat a good person every time.

Along similar lines, besides being my favorite recent Marine Corps General and SecDef, James Mattis was incredibly quotable!

> Allowing bad processes to stump good people is intolerable.

The above Gen Mattis website also lists a bunch of quotable Mattis quotes!
